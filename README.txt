- pages/*.html (1000 SEO landing pages targeting long-tail disposable email keywords)
- sitemap.xml
- robots.txt
- package.json (use `npx http-server` to preview)
- assets/ (styles/scripts embedded inline for critical performance)

Quick preview:
- Unzip and run: npx http-server . -p 8080

SEO notes (starter recommendations):
- Verify keywords with your preferred KW tool (Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, SEMrush) and replace as needed.
- Add server-side rendering or serve these as static files via CDN (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
- Secure a fast hosting + CDN, enable Brotli/Gzip, use HTTP/2, and set proper cache headers.
- Add high-quality backlinks, build content clusters, and monitor Core Web Vitals.

Important:
This static generator provides unique page templates and metadata, but you MUST validate keyword volumes and difficulty with SEO tools before large-scale deployment.
